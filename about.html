		<p>My name is Heather Stevens and I'm a front-end web developer.</p>

		<p>I take a design centric approach to my websites thanks to my interests in the fine arts and design. While in university I focused on filmmaking and photography, but upon taking a course in web design I realized that I really enjoyed writing code and seeing what I could make from it. Since then I have taken art classes and spent a few years doing administrative work for a non-profit which has given me great organizational and people skills, but now I'm ready to get back to my true calling.</p>

		<p>My knowledge encompasses HTML5, CSS3, and a modest amount of Javascript but I am always learning. I also have certifications in Google Analytics and Google Adwords and have a foundation of digital marketing knowledge that will help me create a site that is primed for SEO and marketing your business.</p>

		<p>Check out my work on my <a href="index.html">portfolio</a> or if you'd like to hire me, please <a href="contact.html">contact me.</a> And of course, have a wonderful day!</p>
